Noa Cohen's lab at the School of Software Engineering and Computer Science at [The Azrieli College of Engineering](https://www.jce.ac.il/) studies computational biology. Our research covers 
a wide range of topics, including biofilm research and personalized medicine in cancer research. Our goal is to develop user-friendly open-source tools that will be accessible to other bioinformaticians and biology researchers.
